# Install & updating

Requirements: **herdr 0.7.4+**, on **Linux** or **macOS** (native Windows
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is a [preview](windows.md)). **Git** must be on `PATH` at
runtime. The viewer shells out to the system `git` CLI (read-only subcommands) for the
git-aware tree (status markers, changed-only filter, baseline toggle) and the diff view.
Without git the viewer still opens, but those features are degraded (no status colors, no
diffs). The optional renderers (`glow` / `delta` / `bat`) are separate.
The system `curl` is optional: without it, document retrieval is unavailable without an error.
See [external renderers](renderers.md).

> **No Rust toolchain needed when a prebuilt exists.** `herdr plugin install smarzban/herdr-file-viewer`
> downloads a prebuilt, SHA-256-verified binary for your platform (macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux x86_64,
> Windows x86_64 preview).
> The prebuilt is matched by **version**, so you get it even when `main` is ahead of the latest tag.
> You'll receive the most recent released binary (a note tells you when newer, unreleased changes
> aren't in it yet). It builds from source with `cargo` (Rust 1.96+) only when there's no matching
> prebuilt at all: an unsupported platform, or a version that hasn't been released yet. The install
> command is the same either way.

**Install through herdr**: herdr runs the manifest's `[[build]]` step at install time, either
downloading a prebuilt binary or compiling from source, producing `./target/release/herdr-file-viewer`,
which the viewer pane launches:

```bash
# install (and update, re-run any time to get the latest):
herdr plugin install smarzban/herdr-file-viewer
# …optional: pin a specific older version for reproducibility:
herdr plugin install smarzban/herdr-file-viewer --ref v1.0.0

# or, for local development, link this checkout in place:
cargo build --release            # plugin link does NOT run the [[build]] step, so build first
herdr plugin link /path/to/herdr-file-viewer
```

> You don't need `--ref` to stay current. A bare install pulls the latest. See [Updating](#updating).

Confirm it registered with `herdr plugin list`. To build manually outside herdr:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## After installing

herdr's install output is intentionally terse (`Installed …` / `Config: …`) and won't prompt you,
so two quick steps remain:

1. **Bind a key** to summon the viewer. See [Quick start](../README.md#quick-start) (or
   [Summoning the viewer](summoning.md) for the four layouts (split, tab, overlay, popup) and the
   `--remote` caveat). No key bound yet? Open it once from the CLI:
   `herdr plugin action invoke open-file-viewer --plugin herdr-file-viewer`.
2. **(Optional) install the renderers** (`glow` / `delta` / `bat`) so markdown, diffs, and code are
   styled instead of plain text. See [external renderers](renderers.md). The viewer works without
   them (plain-text fallback).

## Updating

herdr has no plugin auto-update. An advisory status row can point to `?` for release details.
Installation remains manual: re-run the install yourself to get the latest:

```bash
herdr plugin install smarzban/herdr-file-viewer
```

- You **don't** need `--ref` to stay current; it only *pins* a specific version (and a pin stays
  pinned until you change it).
- Want a heads-up the moment a release ships? On GitHub, **Watch → Custom → Releases**.
- Prefer no remote notices? Set [`update_check = false`](configuration.md), or set
  `HERDR_FILE_VIEWER_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` when the config key is absent. The check otherwise runs at
  most once per 24h and never blocks the viewer when offline.
